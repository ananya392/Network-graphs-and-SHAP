# Network-graphs-and-SHAP
This project uses network graphs to analyse the dataset with centrality measures like degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and clustering coefficient. To further explore the dataset ml models are trained and SHAP analysis is done to identify influential features.
